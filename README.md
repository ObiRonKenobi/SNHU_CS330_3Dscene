Computational Graphics and Visualization






How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by considering the end user's requirements, developing a plan to create the functionality required
to meet the end user's needs, and then incrementally develop the object and functions.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach developing software in an incremental manner. Developing one feature or function at a time and regularly compiling as
I go to avoid errors.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science will help me find a new career in tech. Computational graphics has provided me with an understanding of how digital
images are created and how they interact with other things like light sources and perspective changes.
